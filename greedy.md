# Greedy Algorithm

def: An algorithmic paradigmthat follows the problem  solving approach  of making the locally optimal choice<br />
at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.<br />

**pros: simple ,easy to implement, run fast** <br />
**cons: very often they don't provide a globally optimum solution** <br />
